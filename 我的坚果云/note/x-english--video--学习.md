Every morning, when you open your eyes, first think about what you need to do next in English;

When you hear English songs or podcasts, visualize the scenes described in your mind;

Do not connect English with reality through your mother tongue, but directly connect English with reality;

At the beginning, do not pay too much attention to grammar and speed, and be brave in trying, as it is more important than a perfect result, but also be careful to avoid some mistakes;

Every week, review the past seven days in your mind in English;

Definitely practice more, continuously improve your proficiency, and avoid mistakes.
